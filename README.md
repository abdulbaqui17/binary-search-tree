Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in [programming language]. The BST is a fundamental data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Features
Insertion: Add new elements to the tree while maintaining the BST property.
Deletion: Remove elements from the tree while preserving the BST structure.
Search: Find elements in the tree with logarithmic time complexity.
Traversal: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals are supported.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
[Programming language] installed (version [version_number])
[Any other dependencies or tools]
Installation
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-search-tree.git
cd binary-search-tree
# Compile or run any setup script here
Usage
python
Copy code
# Example usage in [programming language]
from binary_search_tree import BinarySearchTree

# Create a new BST
bst = BinarySearchTree()

# Insert elements
bst.insert(5)
bst.insert(3)
bst.insert(7)

# Search for an element
result = bst.search(3)
print("Element found:", result)

# Perform in-order traversal
bst.in_order_traversal()
